# intercom
Basic Python scripts which checks the same network as it to see if anyone else is running the script, and if yes will connect to them. If it is running as a server a javascript ui is included (wokring on it) to control the functions the server is sending to the client(s).
I hope to design a framework around this code that allows you to use any of it's features in any other python script.
