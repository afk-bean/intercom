Basic Python scripts which checks the same network as it to see if anyone else is running the script, and if yes will connect to them. If it is running as a server a javascript ui is included (wokring on it) to control the functions the server is sending to the client(s).
I hope to design a framework around this code that allows you to use any of it's features in any other python script.

To run this script(s), all you need is python 3.6+ and the following modules installed from pip:

tqdm
websockets






and javascript must also be enabled on your browser for the ui to work.

This is not completed yet, but soon, we will prevail to the level of completion that we (I) desire.
